#### 💻 Relevant Projects:
  - 💸 [Mastercard Machine Learning Challenge Project](https://github.com/Anas10202/mastercard_fraud_detection) (Break Through Tech AI Program):
    - My first real-world ML project! As part of the BTT AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio, I collaborated on a team to tackle Mastercard's challenge project of developing a ML model capable of predicting credit card fraud. This proved to be a challenge indeed, since the [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) we used was highly imbalanced, but I am proud of the work my team and I accomplished together!
  - 📧 [Cybersecurity Natural Language Processing Capstone Project](https://github.com/ashleytln/BTT-AI-ML-Foundations/tree/main/Final-Project-NLP-Email-Spam) (Break Through Tech AI Program):
    - My first project incorporating cybersecurity with machine learning! For my capstone project for the BTT Machine Learning Foundations course, I decided to venture out and find my own data set that combined the two things I am most interested in: cybersecurity and machine learning. I tried my best to take a stab at this [Kaggle email spam data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset) by evaluating logistic regression, random forest, and neural network models and would appreciate any feedback!
  - [Sudoku Puzzle Validity Checker](https://github.com/ashleytln/computer-science-i-projects/blob/main/Project2/SudokuPuzzleValidityChecker_SmartPtr.cpp):
    - One of my first course projects done in C++! I just learned what pointers were and had never heard of smart pointers, so this was definitely a challenge! Using file input, I developed a program that displayed the validity of a Sudoku puzzle (and each reason why the puzzle is invalid, if applicable). The different puzzle statuses consist of: solved (contains no empty and no conflicting boxes), valid (contains empty boxes but no conflicting boxes), and invalid (contains conflicting boxes). This was a project I enjoyed, since it required me to be conscious of memory access via pointers while also experimenting with a concept I had freshly learned!
